Have worn many hats, but can usually be found in a Red Sox cap.

Currently: Scholar @OpenAI. I'm interested in how to make language models safe and fair, from a technical and policy perspective. I'm a born and bred New Yorker, now in SF, have unutilized and unexpired learner's permits on both coasts.

Previously: Led product management at The Whistle, a small start-up building tech tools for international human rights groups. Before that, researched economic policy at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and worked with the Department of Digital Culture, Media and Sport in the UK on online advertising policy. BA in Computer Science and Math from Williams College and an MPhil in Technology Policy from the University of Cambridge (Herschel-Smith Fellow).
